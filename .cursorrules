# Guide for Implementing GPT-4o for Data Extraction and Pinecone Embedding

## Extract Text from PDFs Using GPT-4o

1. Convert PDF pages to images.
2. Encode images to base64.
3. Send images to GPT-4o for text extraction.

## Generate Embeddings for the Extracted Text

1. Select an appropriate embedding model.
2. Generate embeddings using the OpenAI API.

## Store Embeddings in Pinecone

1. Initialize Pinecone with your API key.
2. Create a new index with the appropriate dimensionality.
3. Upsert the embeddings into the Pinecone index.

## Querying Pinecone

1. Generate an embedding for your query.
2. Use Pinecone to retrieve relevant documents.

*Note: Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations and stay informed about updates to OpenAI's models and Pinecone's features.*
